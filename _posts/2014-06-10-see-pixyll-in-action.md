I'll soon start blogging about my Adventures in Web Development with [PureScript](http://purescript.org).

### Source Code

Code blocks use the [solarized](http://ethanschoonover.com/solarized) theme. 
I switched out solarized dark for the light version because i usually prefer it that way. 

{% highlight purescript %}
deleteBlock :: Block -> AppState -> AppState
deleteBlock b as = as { blocks = filter (\b' -> b' /= b ) as.blocks
                      , timeslots = M.fromList $ topicslotFilter (M.toList as.timeslots)}
  where topicslotFilter = filter (\(Tuple (Slot s) _) -> s.block /= b)
{% endhighlight %}

Here's some CSS:

{% highlight css %}
.foobar {
  /* Named colors rule */
  color: tomato;
}
{% endhighlight %}

Here's some JavaScript:

{% highlight js %}
var isPresent = require('is-present')

module.exports = function doStuff(things) {
  if (isPresent(things)) {
    doOtherStuff(things)
  }
}
{% endhighlight %}

Here's some HTML:

{% highlight html %}
<div class="m0 p0 bg-blue white">
  <h3 class="h1">Hello, world!</h3>
</div>
{% endhighlight %}

# Headings!

They're responsive, and well-proportioned (in `padding`, `line-height`, `margin`, and `font-size`).
They also heavily rely on the awesome utility, [BASSCSS](http://www.basscss.com/).

##### They draw the perfect amount of attention

This allows your content to have the proper informational and contextual hierarchy. Yay.

### There are lists, too

  * Apples
  * Oranges
  * Potatoes
  * Milk

  1. Mow the lawn
  2. Feed the dog
  3. Dance

### Images look great, too

### There are also pretty colors

Also the result of [BASSCSS](http://www.basscss.com/), you can <span class="bg-dark-gray white">highlight</span> certain components
of a <span class="red">post</span> <span class="mid-gray">with</span> <span class="green">CSS</span> <span class="orange">classes</span>.

I don't recommend using blue, though. It looks like a <span class="blue">link</span>.

### Footnotes!

Markdown footnotes are supported, and they look great! Simply put e.g. `[^1]` where you want the footnote to appear,[^1] and then add
the reference at the end of your markdown.

### Stylish blockquotes included

You can use the markdown quote syntax, `>` for simple quotes.

> Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit. Suspendisse quis porta mauris.

However, you need to inject html if you'd like a citation footer. I will be working on a way to
hopefully sidestep this inconvenience.

<blockquote>
  <p>
    Perfection is achieved, not when there is nothing more to add, but when there is nothing left to take away.
  </p>
  <footer><cite title="Antoine de Saint-Exupéry">Antoine de Saint-Exupéry</cite></footer>
</blockquote>

### There's more being added all the time

Checkout the [Github repository](https://github.com/johnotander/pixyll) to request,
or add, features.

Happy writing.
