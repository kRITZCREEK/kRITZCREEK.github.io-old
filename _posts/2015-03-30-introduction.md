## Greetings

Hello and welcome to my new blog. I'm Christoph Hegemann, a 23 year old computer science student who loves functional programming.

I'm from a Gummersbach, a city close to Cologne, which is in Germany.

When I'm not programming at work, I'm programming at home, and when I'm not doing that I mess around with my cat __Nemo__ (_Yes he tends to be hard to find_ ;)).

On this site I intend to post tutorials and thoughts about functional programming in general and more specific _Functional Web Development_.

I also promise to add a cat picture every now and then.

Until then... See you and happy hacking!
